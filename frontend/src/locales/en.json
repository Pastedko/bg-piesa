    "p1": "All Bulgarian drama in one place – this is our credo, our faith and our mission statement. All dramatic literature written for the Theatre in Bulgaria, gathered under one roof – from “The Bishop of Lovech or the Trouble of the Lovech Clockmaker”, “The Misunderstood Civilization” and “Ivanko, the Murderer of Asen I” to the most recent award-winning works from our competitions for new Bulgarian plays. That is the boldly ambitious task our team has set itself.",
    "p2": "Within this platform there will be a section for theoretical texts tracing the twists and turns of the Bulgarian play through time and space. Somewhere in the imagination of the conspirators behind the project there is also a section with translations of the texts into major European, neighbouring and various other languages, so that the Bulgarian playwright can step not only onto the native Olympus, but also onto other foreign peaks and see how far they have come.",
    "p3": "We also aim to collect invaluable information about competitions, forums, festivals, platforms and stages where the Author of texts for the Theatre can meet kindred spirits, exchange experience and share what they think, dream and suffer. There will be short biographies of the authors, the story of each presented play, what critics have seen in it, posters, photographs, video and other treasures. Greetings in body and spirit – and onward, playwrights!"
